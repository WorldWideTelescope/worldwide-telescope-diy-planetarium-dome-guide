1. Connect a laptop computer to the projector, and if possible to the
   internet. Without an internet connection you will be restricted to showing
   the tours and collections files that are stored locally on the laptop, so
   in this case run all the tours you might need once (which stores them
   locally) whilst connected to the internet, before removing the connection
   and moving to the dome.
2. Run the AAS WorldWide Telescope Windows Client on the laptop. The Web
   Client (based on Silverlight) does not currently support the dome warping
   software, so make sure you are using the downloaded Windows Client version,
   and that the version number (which can be verified in the **About WorldWide
   Telescope** dialog) is 2.6.2.1 or later. It is recommended that you use a
   Windows based laptop (Windows XP/Vista/7) for simplicity, but you can use a
   Mac laptop with a Windows partition.
3. Select **Full Dome** from the **View** menu, then select **Dome Setup** to
   bring up the following dialog:

   <!-- ![](DomeSetupDialog.jpg) NOT FOUND -->

   For most modern projectors the aspect ratio is 16:9, so set the **Dome
   Type** to **Mirrordome 16:9**. If you are using an older VGA projector,
   then the aspect ratio may well be 4:3, so set this value to **Mirrordome
   4:3.** Refer to the **Configuration** section of the
   [WorldWide Telescope User Guide](WorldWideTelescopeUserGuide.html) for
   details if your projector is neither of these.

   Set **Dome Tilt** to 70 percent. This value contains the center of interest
   in vertical degrees.

   For high resolution projectors (1920 x 1080 or similar) select **Large
   Textures**, otherwise leave this unselected.

   Click **OK**.
5. In the **Full Dome** menu ensure **Full Dome** has a tick beside it.
6. If you wish to control the presentation by looking at the laptop, then you
   are good to go - the mouse movements and clicks on the laptop screen
   control the view. If you wish to control the presentation by looking at the
   dome projection, then select **Detach Main View to Second Monitor**.
   Consider using an XBox controller in this latter case, as input control has
   now be passed to the dome view and controlling the presentation with a
   mouse can be awkward.
7. Invite your students and peers!
